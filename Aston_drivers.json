		"description":"Sebastian Vettel was a child prodigy and joined Formula 1 when he was just 19 years old. In 2010 he became the youngest ever world champion at 23 years old and dominated the sport for the following 3 years accumulating 4 in total.",
 		"career":"He made his Formula 1 debur in 2007 driving for BMW Sauber where he became the youngest driver to score points before he moveds to Toro Rosso for the second half of the year and 2008. At the Italian Grand Prix in 2008 he became the youngest driver in history to win a Grand Prix meaning the Red Bull junior team won a race before the main team. Toro Rosso also finished above Red Bull in the standings that year.</p><p>Vettel moved to Red Bull for 2009 where he won the second race of the season in China which was also Red Bull's first win. The team and Vettel ended up second in their respective championships. In 2010 he was just about in the title fight bewteen his teamate Mark Webber, the McLaren drivers (Hamilton and Button) and Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso. He won by 4 points at the last race of the season in Abu Dhabi making him the youngest driver to ever win a WDC. He dominated the 2011 season winning 11 out of the 19 races and podium finishes in 17 of them. The 2012 title fight was a bit closer but be ended up winning it by 3 points to Fernando Alonso. 2013 was the year he won his last championship but it was also his most dominante winning 13 out of 19 races. This year also made him the most hated Formula 1 driver for how much he kept winning and his attitude meaning on multiple occassions he was booed by fans. This year also saw the infamous multi-21 incident where his teamate Webber was P1 and Vettel P2 and after being told to keep position he overtook Webber and won the race. This lead to Webber remarking 'multi 21 Seb, yeah multi 21' in the cooldown room, increased tensions between the two and in the team and increase hate for Vettel especially after he said that '[he does] not apoligise for winning'. The following year he couldn't get to grips with the new tyres and the RB10 and suffered from reliability problems meaning he was beaten by his new young teamate Daniel Riccardo.</p><p>He moved to Ferrari for the 2015 season to race alongside Kimi Raikkonen. They performed really well however the Mercedes were in another league and beat everyone by a mile but Vettel still won a few races. 2016 was much the same but Red Bull were more of a chanllenge as well. 2017 was Vettel's firsty chance at fightinh for a championship since 2013. He took the lead in the beginning of the season but by the British Grand Prix his lead was cut to only 1 point but by the end of the year Hamilton has passed him and won. He did manage to split the Mercedes though which was the first time the championship hadn't ended 1-2 for Mercedes since 2014. The 2018 season was dubbed the 'Fight For Five' as the two 4 time world champions were in a title fight and like the season before Vettel got of to a good start but it was close for most of the season. A notable race was his home race on Hockenheim where he crashed as rain started causing him to break his front wing; some poeple would say he was never the same after this moment as it cost him his last chance at another title. In 2019 he had a new teamate Charles Leclerc who was only in his second season who ended up outscoring him and Vettel finished the season 5th. 2020 was his last year with Ferrari and with the SF1000 lackingpace he had his worst full campaign in his Formula 1 career.</p><p>For the last 2 years of his career he raced for Aston Martin alongside Lance Stroll and outscored him in both seasons and had the most overtakes in 2019 that won him the inaugural Overtake Award. He missed the first 2 races of the 2022 season due to positive COVID-19 tests and announced his retiremant by the end of the 2022 season. Since retiring Vettel has used his notariaty to raise awareness for environmental issues and social injustices."

 		"career":"He started Formula 1 in 2001 with Minardi but moved to Benetton the following year as a test driver and was promoted to Renault for 2003 he won the championship in 2005 and 2006 for Renault before moving to McLaren for 2007. There were issues in McLaren that lead to neither driver winning that season so he returned to Renault in 2008. Nothing happened in Renault so he moved to Ferrari for the 2010 season. He fought for the championship for the next 4 seasons but was beaten by Sebastian Vettel everytime. 2014 didn't go well so he moved back to McLaren but it didn't get any better and he subsequently retired from Formula 1 at the end of the 2018 season. However, he returned to Formula 1 in 2021 to race for Alpine (formerly Renault) and moved to Aston Martin in 2023 and comtinues to drive for them today."
